* DONE Ability to override responses from chat.

* Clean up chat history where appropriate on server side.
* Create a builder superclass.  Try to abtract as much as possible.
* Move show visuals rendering to client.  Just pass back an action that contains json list of icons and ids.
* add ring, amulet, glove, boot creation.
* make ChatService more generic
** Have the ChatFrame interface be String chat(); with no parameters.  Force user to write delegates to @RegisterAIService
** returning null means no response message.
** Force user to register delegates on startup.
** Create a delegate abstract superclass to do things like registration. (if creating a quarkus extension, just scan for beans that implement the chat interface and do the registration)
** rename it to ChatFrameService
* expand boost macro support
* Show spell/skill tooltips

RAG Improvements:
* Review created documents that are being fed into vector DB
* Create a SQL DB of equipment items, generate a SQL query based on that
* RAG Fusion: Do multiple queries in parallel (AI and SQL)  fuse results together based on ranking (how many times does item show up in each query)
* HyDE: Generate a hypothetical document that answers the question well.  Then use the embeddings to do a search.

Don't think we can use these RAG techniques:
* Router:  Multiple datasources (vectorDB, RDBMs)  WRite a prompt that analyzes user messages and chooses where to send data.
* Summary Vector DBs.  Summarize a document and store each summary in a vector db with metadata to point to original documents.
